If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
==> No, because title and category are both of type string so a method that only uses title or category would have similar signature.

Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
	Java is always pass by value, because even though a variable might hold a reference to an object, that object 	reference is a value that represents the objectâ€™s location in memory. Object references are therefore passed 	by value


Alternatively, to compare items in the cart, instead of using Comparator, we can use the 
Comparable interface and override the compareTo()method. You can refer to the Java docs to see the 
information of this interface. 
Suppose we are taking this Comparable interface approach.

What class should implement the Comparable interface?
 	-> Class Media
In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method be to reflect the ordering that we 
want?
 	-> Override compareTo() method such as :
	public int compareTo(Media m) {
        	return this.getTitle().compareTo(student.getTitle());
    	} 
	Collections.sort(listMedia);
Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this 
Comparable interface approach?
	-> Of course we can, for example :
	public int compareTo(Media m) {
		if(this.getTitle().compareTo(m.getTitle() > 0){
			return 1;
		}
		else if(this.getTitle().compareTo(m.getTitle() < 0){
			return -1;
		}
		else{
			if(this.getCost() >= m.getCost())
				return 1;
			else
				return -1
		}
    	} 

Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing 
length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
	-> We can use thenComparing of Comparator or use if else
