If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
==> No, because title and category are both of type string so a method that only uses title or category would have similar signature.

Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
	Java is always pass by value, because even though a variable might hold a reference to an object, that object 	reference is a value that represents the objectâ€™s location in memory. Object references are therefore passed 	by value
